    <h1>Harmonics, Music and Organizing a Team</h1>
    
    <p class="my-p">
    In Japanese comic named "Nodame Cantabile", there is a person whose name is Shinichi Chiaki. Chiaki is a conductor. A conductor unite an orchestra. Only knowing about conductor is enough to unite the music team? Author thinks the answer is no.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    In the theory of fourier transform, every function can be expressed by combination of sin and cos waves with every frequency. What is fourier transform? The ordinary reader may have a question. A reader may know Japanese karaoke and equalizer. One can emphasize vocal by equalizer. That is all about sin and cos waves. That is done by fourier transform.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p"></p>
    Author suppose that is all the same for orchestra. In an orchestra, there are may musical instruments. There are may sin and cos waves. By combination of musical instruments, sin and cos wave, orchestra is made. The remaining thing is a team leader who is a conductor.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p"></p>
    Actually Chiaki is very well at violin and piano. Author suppose because Chiaki has speciality about violin and piano, he can understand every music instruments and therefore he is success as a conductor.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p"></p>
    Without having some speciality of some music instruments, it is not possible to be a leader or a conductor. This is my answer.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p"></p>
    This is all about story and comic. The question is it is also the truth at an actual industry? The answer is affirmative. That is described in later section.
