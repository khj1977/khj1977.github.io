    <h1>Product manager, head of growth hack office and control engineering</h1>
    
    <p class="my-p">
    Product manger (PdM) is a position to unify multiple function as matrix type organization against tree type organization. Generally speaking, PdM is difficult and it fails. Why? There may be some reasons. Author thinks that the main point is lack of power;i.e. PdM is manager level but it is required to organize team against General Managers (GM) or executive officer level persons.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    Author was a PdM at a high tech IT venture called C2cube. It was failed. That is because of fact that author was manager level but it is required to organize executive officer level persons. Moreover, there were lack of MBA type knowledge and experience though author was a specialist of research of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning.
    </p>
    
    <p class="my-p">
    Author was a head of growth hack office which is a tactics officer and have a power which is better than GMs but lesser than executive officer. Moreover, there was a head of strategic planning office who is strategy officer and executive officer and we have a relationship to co-organize a team as a dual product manager where there are 6 departments, which are 1. strategic planning office, 2. tactics office, 3. department of system, 4. department of marketing, 5. department of production, 6. department of real shop.
    </p>
    
    <p class="my-p">
    Also, there were meeting where all member of that company attend. In that meeting, there were presentations by each GMs and there were discussion against each topics. That means that there are organic feedback between dual product managers, each GMs and all company members. Finally, author has MBA type knowledge and experience to use such a knowledge in actual situation.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    If I were control engineer at Jaguar, I will lead a team of automatic control vehicle using experience of robust control, machine learning and MBA with power of PdM.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    Only robust control? It could be. However, author suppose it would be difficult.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    Why? Because there should be multiple expertise to lead a team. Without having multiple expertise, it would be difficult to have appropriate questions  and to understand a content of discussion in multiple expertise.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    What is a key driver? Author thinks it is triple master;i.e. M.Phil (robust control), MS level knowledge and experience of NLP/Machine Learning, MBA type knowledge and experience. Author is close to triple master. Author thinks that this is a reason author succeeds as head of office.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    Author thinks this is the same as Nodame;i.e. Author thinks Chiaki is close to triple master therefore, he succeeds.
