    <h1>The refined conclusion remarks and further work</h1>

    <p class="my-p">
    This thesis is all about what is a modelling, what is a control and what is a robustness. That is all. Rest of topics which had been investigated is described in my core M.Phil thesis.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    "I will go to economics." That was said just after my VIVA, the final presentation of my M.Phil research. This is all about rest of my career. Aim of my M.Phil research is to reduce energy consumption of mechanical systems. My private motivation is to make ultimately new bicycle. Why I changed my purpose or aim? That is a because of fact that I had done everything in terms of theory for smart material systems. Then, I thought to see about other persons and society. This is an effect to U.K culture.

    When I was a high school and undergraduate student, from my point view, Japan seems to have everything though it was after bubble of economy. Thus, I chose to chase my own dream. Now, 2022, however, Japan seems to lose everything. That is why I am now working as strategic consultant and IT architect.

    <p class="my-p">
    I thought to make the economy of South Korea better to unify South Korea and North Korea after 20 - 40 years later after my M.Phil.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    The problem of Korean Peninsula has got close to end. Then, I switched to Japanese problem.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    Is Japan deflation? No. It is stagflation. Is Japan leading country in the world? No. Its GDP per person is not so high anymore. I think it is very dangerous situation.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    Is it possible to turn around Japan? I think the answer is affirmative in the sense of strategy. <a href="/profile/FAQ.html">Here is all strategy (in Japanese)</a> required to Japan namely: "New Abenomics 5 + 2 arrows".
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    I am upper master, bilingual and IT person. I can survive if a country's common language is English. Therefore, I will remain in Japan just before it gets collapsed.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    Finally, I would like to close this thesis by special acknowledgements to some persons. Firstly, I would like to express special thanks to my super visors at my M.Phil research in Coventry University: Dr. David and Dr. Keith. Without their support and discussion, this thesis would not be exist. Also, I would like to show special gratitude to Dr. Kawai and Dr. Sankai in University of Tsukuba. Dr. Kawai permitted me as being PI even it failed. Dr. Sakai suggested me to be a control engineer and taught me several interesting topics about research. Finally, I would like to express special thanks to Mr. Naoya Ito. Without culture of Japanese web industry he made and a system called Hatena Book Mark2, I would not be exist as an IT engineer.

    The author believes that Japan gets recovered and its GDP per person gets better.
