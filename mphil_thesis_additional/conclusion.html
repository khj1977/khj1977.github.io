    <h1>The refined conclusion remarks and further work</h1>

    <p class="my-p">
    This thesis is all about what is a modelling, what is a control and what is a robustness. That is all.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    Here is author's suggestion about applications for this theory.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    Target of control of this research is material such as CFRP. However, there could be other kind of application areas such as fluid dynamics and electro-magnet dynamics. It means that even mechanical heart could be target of control and better or faster mobile phone than 5G could be made. Ultimatelly, if it were controllable, even whether could be controlled.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    Is there better alloy than MacBook Air and iPhone? Actually, this thesis is written by MacBook Air whose material seems special. iPhone seems to use special alloy. MacBook Air suddenly appeared about 10 years before from now. Provided that, if Yet Another Mori-Tanaka is used to make better alloy, is it possible to make better material for Note PC and especially for smart phone? In recent year, every person use smart phone. Without smart phone, we cannot spend any life anymore. Author supposes that the answer to the question for material of smart phone is affirmative.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    There are several topics which should be investigated as further work:
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    It is supposed that nominal matrix obtained via digital langrangian is too high order, its order of calculation by CPU via DA converter get really high. If it were too high and not calculated  by one CPU, super fast CPU or distributed CPU will be required. It is supposed that if calculation is linear, it is possible to handle by distributed parallel processing such as MapReduce.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    It is supposed that if piezo material is attached over all x-y region of host material, and if digital point of lagrangian is taken small enough, nominal system converges to controllable and observable.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    It is uncertain that robustness and order of calculation if there are digital control version of K-Disturbance Observer.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    It is also uncertain that accuracy of piezo material.

    <p class="my-p">
    If a nominal system is nonlinear, if a system matrix obtained via taylor series with each state, and if it were controllable and observable for each time t, it could be possible to control robustly using K-Disturbance Observer. Moreover, it is supposed that if nonlinear gain schedule controller with appropriate boundary with gain K shown in numerical simulation example, it could be controlled with nonlinear feedback.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    In this thesis, the robustness with K-Disturbance Observer for high order linear uncertain system, which is smart material systems, is proved mathematically. Since there are problem of order of calculation, max limitation of control input and accuracy of piezo material, it is uncertain that it can be controlled robustly in practice. Also, since it is required to be proved mathematically, control algorithm is made as simple. Therefore, transient response could not be so good. However, it is shown that as a theotry, it can be controlled robustly.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    Rest of topics which had been investigated is described in my core M.Phil thesis.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    "I will go to economics." That was said just after my VIVA, the final presentation of my M.Phil research. This is all about rest of my career.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    Aim of my M.Phil research is to reduce energy consumption of mechanical systems. My private motivation is to make ultimately new bicycle. Why I changed my purpose or aim? That is because of fact that I had done everything in terms of theory for smart material systems. Then, I thought to see about other persons and society. This is an effect of U.K culture.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    When I was a high school and undergraduate student, from my point view, Japan seems to have everything though it was after bubble of economy. Thus, I chose to chase my own dream. Now, 2022, however, Japan seems to lose everything. That is why I am now working as strategic consultant and IT architect.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    I thought to make the economy of South Korea better to unify South Korea and North Korea after 20 - 40 years later after my M.Phil. This is why I chose being as an investment banker or a IT person who make ERP system. 
    </p>
    
    <p class="my-p">
    Why economics if it were about Korean Peninsula? I thought it is very similar to unification of West and East Germany. Around 1990, author suppose West Germany was one of the best in the world in the sense of economy. Even so, it might be difficult to acquire East Germany because an economy of East Germany is weak. It is obvious North Korea is economically weak country. What is an economy of South Korea? In South Korea, there are Samsung, LG and Hynndai now. But in the past, it was weak. Thus, I tought to do global optimization of South Korean economy using the power of investment bank or ERP system.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    Actually, there was Asian Financial Crisis around 1997. By that phenomenon, South Korea got under control of IMF. However, it has been recovered. Now, they have Samsung, LG and Hynndai. Its GDP per person is now close to that of Japan. The problem of Korean Peninsula has got close to end. Then, I switched to Japanese problem.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    Is Japan deflation? No. It is stagflation. Is Japan leading country in the world? No. Its GDP per person is not so high anymore. I think it is very dangerous situation.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    Is it possible to turn around Japan? I think the answer is affirmative in the sense of strategy. <a href="/profile/FAQ.html">Here is all strategy (in Japanese)</a> required to Japan namely: "New Abenomics 5 + 2 arrows".
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    I am British upper master, bilingual and IT person. I can survive if a country's common language is English. Therefore, I will remain in Japan just before it gets collapsed.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    In New Abenomics, there is about new industry and VC. That is a part of strategy of Japanese government. So, what is an implementation? Author thinks one of those are quantum physics and magic with digital lagrangian and their industry applications. Is it British joke? No. Author is serious. Recently, Silicon Valley has been changed. There are huge amount of equity finance and new kind of venture which is not web anymore.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    Is the new industry ended by IT such as Google? Author thought that is yes. But it is not anymore as described above. How to pursuit Silicon Valley? How does it growthed in new industries? The answer is: 1. to make better doctors; 2. to make better finance persons such as double master and experienced persons; 3. to make better finance scheme; 4. to make better environment to incubate venture company; 5. to make better bridge between universities and venture companies.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    Making quantum physics venture and magic venture and its industry applications is just a dream and it is impossible? There is cybernics and HAL in University of Tsukuba. There is Smart Material Systems in Coventry Univeristy and University of Warwick. Both of them require many years to realize in industry. We did it. So, why quantum physics venture and magic venture cannot be made? The author cannot find any reason to reject that idea.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    What is a quantum physics? Author does not know much about that subject. But author knows there is PDE called Schrödinger equation. It is sometimes ODE, sometimes PDE. If it were PDE, numerical calculation could be done using Finite Element Method (FEM). However, if there is energy of Schrödinger equation, what will be happened? It could be converted to high order ODE and then, it could be analyzed and even controlled. This is author's hypothesis. Author would like to know answers from pure physics researchers. Is it problem of science? Is it problem of applied physics? Is it problem of engineering?
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    As well as better doctor, better master is required. Master is a lesser doctor? Compared with doctor, lesser insight for research? Author thinks it is no. My definition of master is using the power of research, engineering and science, to tackle to real business. Actually, as a head of growth hack office, author deployed my ability of hypothesis driven and numerical analysis technique and lead the team success. Authoir is upper master and being in the field of business though author is a half researcher. In that sense, upper master is enough for author.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    Now, at 2022, I am 45 years old. Dr Sankai said to me that "You will baton touch to other persons when you get 20 years later.". I was about 25 years old in that time. When I was a head of growth hack office and specialist of system develop department, I said to all company's member: "I will resign head of office 10 years later" which was about story at 2016 and I was 39 years old.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    I have my core work which is operation kaizen and business application framework. It will require 10 years to complete requirement in the sense of business or policy of Kasumigaseki which is called working style evolution.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    Although it is little bit late, after 10 years later from now, I will switch to education. Which university I will go? University of Tsukuba? Keio University? My current answer is NMD college which is private study/research group. It cannot grant degree. But really degree matters? Is it OK not being as official university? I think the answer is yes. It is a style of Shibuya and Roppongi. Keio University had been a private study group at start but it is one of the best private univeristy in Japan now. Why not NMD college?
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
      There is a suggestion to Ministry of Education of Japan. Could you please teach high school students about connection between mathematics, physics and computer science? There are applications even in the area of marketing, economics and psychology. I have several topics which can be taught to high school student with interesting applications. It may be hard to re-organize high school text book. But it could be possible to teach from teacher to student by oral communication without text book. It would be better even there is study for University entrance exam since it would be deep understanding if there were real applications with mathematics. There are many hints in Amazon.co.jp or Amazon.com. Please think about that.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    Since this thesis can be read by smart phone, there may be a reader who is a high school student. One may think that he can go to Shinshu University, University of Tsukuba and Coventry University because he had money. I cannot do so because of financial reason of my family. No I didn't. I worked as a bicycle meseenger in Tokyo to earn money for my undergraduate study. I had a tuition fee exemption in Shinshu University. I had a scholarship in my M.Phil/Ph.D research in British University. Please go to University at least until you get master's degree. If you study and research really hard, you can go to very good company such as Jaguar, Honda, Toyota or DeNA. If it were IT, you can be general manager at early 30's. You can earn much money especially in IT industry. Is much money required to study and research? No. Only pen, note, functional calculator and PC is required. Is PC expensive? It is better to buy cheap note book and install Ubuntu. That is all.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    Why education? That is simple. The only resource Japan has is human resource. Thus, to make better country, I will involve in education. It is too simple? Author thinks that since it is essence, it is simple.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    Finally, I would like to close this thesis by special acknowledgements to some organizations and persons.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    First of all, author would like to express special thanks to T-Serv, Kogin (now which is Misuzho Corporate Bank), Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, other investment banks, Bloomberg, McCann Erickson Japan, Daiichi-Kikaku (now which is ADK Holdings), Hakuhodo and Dentsu. Without having their support, I cannot go to Shinshu University and University of Tsukuba as a undergraduate student. Also, author would like to express special thanks to HSBC Bank. They issued me banking card with debit function, credit card and even cheque book even I came form outside EU region. Without their financial support, it is not possible to finish my M.Phil research.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    Author would like to express special thanks to Citibank Japan. Without their financial support after going back to Japan, author cannot spend good life as a researcher of NLP/Machine Learning. Although the area of research is different, without that experience, this final version of thesis will not exist. As well as Citibank, author would like to express special thanks to ex-Kogin VC person and Hakuhodo group. Without their equity finance for C2cube, which is 0.2 billion JPY, author cannot continue to do research of NLP/Machine Learning and then, it is not possible to write this final version of thesis.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    Author would like to express special thanks to Mr. Linus, Mr. Stallman and Dr. Knuth. Without GNU/Linux and LaTeX they made, this theis cannot be written. Also author would like to express special thanks to Microsoft. Actually, this final version of thesis is written by VSCode they made. This text editor is excellent and the very best text editor I have ever used. Author also would like to express special thanks to Apple. The final version of this thesis is written by MacBook Air. This Note PC is the very best hardware I have ever used. In addition, author would like to express special thanks to Dr. Alan Kay, Mr. Steve Jobs, NeXTSTEP and Xerox Palo Alto. Actually, final version of this thesis is written on macOS, macOS is the very best OS I have ever used and the origin of modern macOS is those persons and organizations.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    Author would like to exprss special thanks to Google Global. Without excellent search engine they made, it was not possible to find out Coventry University and cannot find some facts which I want to know on the net for my research and study. Also, author would like to express special thanks to Amazon. Without super book store they made, I cannot continue to have basics and advanced topics especially for computer science and business. Author also would like to express special thanks to Mozilla. Without web browser they made named Firefox, freedom to access to the web may not exist. Author would like to express special thanks to NTT group in Japan. Wihout very best communication network in the world they made, my research may not exist. Author do believe that the net is the key driver to leverage the power of an individual against big companies or organizations.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    Author would like to express special thanks to Hosei University Second High School and its teachers. They applied me very good education. It is a very good environment in the sense of both hardware and software. There is a very good cafeteria, there is a tennis court, there is a place to do baseball. There is a 400m track for sports. We, students, have a freedom to involve in study, hobby or sports. I have a right to study for national university entrance exam in a class room. Since it is university belonging to high school, we are differenet from ordinary high school. It is American style high school but Finland style education at least for me. Author thinks that if author had passion as the same level as I was in England as reseearch student, I could go to Azabu or Kaisei high school. However, for me, Hosei is the best match. Without experience of sport, which is bicycle club both track and road, in that high school, I would not have motivation for mechanical engineering and thus, I would not be applied mathematician. Without beging applied mathematician I cannot be algorithm designer, framework developer and strategic consultant. Therefore the current situation would not exist.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    Next, I would like to express special thanks to my super visors at my M.Phil research in Coventry University: Dr. David and Dr. Keith. Without their support and discussion in the presence of uncertaininty, this thesis would not exist. Also, I would like to show special gratitude to Dr. Kawai and Dr. Sankai in University of Tsukuba. Dr. Kawai permitted me as being PI even it failed. Dr. Sankai suggested me to be a control engineering researcher and taught me several interesting topics about research. Finally, I would like to express special thanks to Mr. Naoya Ito. Without culture of Japanese web industry he made and a system called Hatena Book Mark2, Author would not exist as an IT engineer and author would not be possible to obtain insight for economics and business.
