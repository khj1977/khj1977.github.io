    <h1>The refined conclusion remarks and further work</h1>

    <p class="my-p">
    This thesis is all about what is a modelling, what is a control and what is a robustness. That is all. Rest of topics which had been investigated is described in my core M.Phil thesis.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    "I will go to economics." That was said just after my VIVA, the final presentation of my M.Phil research. This is all about rest of my career.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    Aim of my M.Phil research is to reduce energy consumption of mechanical systems. My private motivation is to make ultimately new bicycle. Why I changed my purpose or aim? That is because of fact that I had done everything in terms of theory for smart material systems. Then, I thought to see about other persons and society. This is an effect of U.K culture.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    When I was a high school and undergraduate student, from my point view, Japan seems to have everything though it was after bubble of economy. Thus, I chose to chase my own dream. Now, 2022, however, Japan seems to lose everything. That is why I am now working as strategic consultant and IT architect.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    I thought to make the economy of South Korea better to unify South Korea and North Korea after 20 - 40 years later after my M.Phil. This is why I chose being as an investment banker or a IT person who make ERP system. 
    </p>
    
    <p class="my-p">
    Why economics if it were about Korean Peninsula? I thought it is very similar to unification of West and East Germany. Around 1990, Author suppose West Germany was one of the best in the world in the sense of economy. Even so, it might be difficult to acquire East Germany because an economy of East Germany is weak. It is obvious North Korea is economically weak country. What is an economy of South Korea? In South Korea, there are Samsung, LG and Hynndai now. But in the past, it was weak. Thus, I tought to do global optimization of South Korean economy using the power of investment bank or ERP system.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    The problem of Korean Peninsula has got close to end. Then, I switched to Japanese problem.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    Is Japan deflation? No. It is stagflation. Is Japan leading country in the world? No. Its GDP per person is not so high anymore. I think it is very dangerous situation.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    Is it possible to turn around Japan? I think the answer is affirmative in the sense of strategy. <a href="/profile/FAQ.html">Here is all strategy (in Japanese)</a> required to Japan namely: "New Abenomics 5 + 2 arrows".
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    I am upper master, bilingual and IT person. I can survive if a country's common language is English. Therefore, I will remain in Japan just before it gets collapsed.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    In New Abenomics, there is about new industry and VC. That is a part of strategy of Japanese government. So, what is an implementation? Author thinks one of those are quantum physics and magic with digital lagrangian and their industry applications. Is it British joke? No. Author is serious. Recently, Silicon Valley has been changed. There are huge amount of equity finance and new kind of venture which is not web anymore.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    Is the new industry ended by IT such as Google? Author thought that is yes. But it is not anymore as described above. How to pursuit Silicon Valley? How does it growthed in new industries? The answer is: 1. to make better doctors; 2. to make better finance persons such as double master and experienced persons; 3. to make better finance scheme; 4. to make better environment to incubate venture company; 5. to make better bridge between universities and venture companies.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    Making quantum physics venture and magic venture and its industry applications is just a dream and it is impossible? There is cybernics and HAL in University of Tsukuba. There is Smart Material Systems in Coventry Univeristy and University of Warwick. Both of them require many years to realize in industry. We did it. So, why quantum physics venture and magic venture cannot be made? The author cannot find any reason to reject that idea.

    Now, at 2022, I am 45 years old. Dr Sankai said to me that "You will baton touch to other persons when you get 20 years later.". I was about 25 years old in that time. When I was a head of growth hack office and specialist of system develop department, I said to all company's member: "I will resign head of office 10 years later" which was about story at 2016 and I was 39 years old.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    I have my core work which is operation kaizen and business application framework. It will require 10 years to complete requirement in the sense of business or policy of Kasumigaseki which is called working style evolution.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    Although it is little bit late, after 10 years later from now, I will switch to education. Which university I will go? University of Tsukuba? Keio University? My current answer is NMD college which is private study/research group. It cannot grant degree. But really degree matters? Is it OK not being as official university? I think the answer is yes. It is a style of Shibuya and Roppongi. Keio University had been a private study group at start but it is one of the best private univeristy in Japan now. Why not NMD college?
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    Why education? That is simple. The only resource Japan has is human resource. Thus, to make better country, I will involve in education. It is too simple? Author thinks that since it is essence, it is simple.

    Finally, I would like to close this thesis by special acknowledgements to some organizations and persons.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    First of all, author would like to express special thanks to T-Serv, Kogin (now which is Misuzho Corporate Bank), Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and other investment banks. Without having their support, I cannot go to Shinshu University and University of Tsukuba as a undergraduate student. Also, author would like to express special thanks to HSBC Bank. They issued me banking card with debit function, credit card and even cheque book even I came form outside EU region. Witought their financial support, it is not possible to finish my M.Phil research.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    Next, I would like to express special thanks to my super visors at my M.Phil research in Coventry University: Dr. David and Dr. Keith. Without their support and discussion in the presence of uncertaininty, this thesis would not exist. Also, I would like to show special gratitude to Dr. Kawai and Dr. Sankai in University of Tsukuba. Dr. Kawai permitted me as being PI even it failed. Dr. Sankai suggested me to be a control engineering researcher and taught me several interesting topics about research. Finally, I would like to express special thanks to Mr. Naoya Ito. Without culture of Japanese web industry he made and a system called Hatena Book Mark2, I would not exist as an IT engineer.

    <p class="my-p">
    The author believes that Japan gets recovered and its GDP per person gets better.
