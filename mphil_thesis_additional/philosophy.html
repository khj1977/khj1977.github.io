    <h1>Research, study and philosophy</h1>
  
    <p class="my-p">
    Methodology of my research is analysis and proof. It is a hard science but engineering. If it were MBA, there would be some discussion as it could be found at Harvard Business Review (HBR). Note that author has not read any academic article of MBA other than HBR.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    If it were mathematics or computer science, there could be early age super genius person. If it were MBA, it should be around 30 years old to enter to MBA course. Why? My answer is experiment. Mathematics can only be done by paper and pen. If it were computer science, everything can be done within CPU. If it were physics, computer calculation is simulation. If it were MBA? One is required to apply his/her theory in real bisiness situation.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    The origin of research and study is philosophy. My degree is not doctor but upper master but there is a word philosophy. It is better than Master of Science and Master of Engineering. Why? Because philosophical speaking, my thesis or research is deeper than M.Sc or M.Eng thesis/research.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    Then, the question is, what is a philosophy? Author thinks that which is what we believe. 
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    My core M.Phil thesis starts from some assumptions. These assumptions are derived by physical insight with modelling of smart material systems. Modelling of smart material systems starts from digital langrangian. Without lagrangian, digital lagrangian cannot be obtained. So, what is behind lagrangian? It is possible to derive newton's equation's motion from lagrangian. Using technique of lagrangian, it is possible to obtain ODE or PDE of fluid dynamics or electro-magnetic dynamics. Then, we can deploy aeroplane or LTE for smart phone. Without newton's way of thinking, it is not possible to spend life with high-techs.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    What is there behind lagrangian and newton's equations motion?
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    Newton may think about his equation with experiment and hypothesis. Author thinks that physics basically done by hypothesis and experiment. Again, engineering applications are depends on newton's way. But newton's equation depends on hypothesis and experiment. Author would say that science is one kind of religion. Author thinks that this religion is appropriate. Why? Because we have vehicle, aeroplane and LTE.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    We believe newton's equation's motion and lagrangian. We believe theory and assumption of linear algebra. If it were MBA? They may believe case study works. This is my answer to that question.
