    <h1>Research, study and philosophy</h1>
  
    <p class="my-p">
    Methodology of my research is analysis and proof. It is a hard science but engineering. If it were MBA, there would be some discussion as which could be found at Harvard Business Review (HBR). Note that author has not read any academic article of MBA other than HBR.

    <p class="my-p">
    If it were mathematics or computer science, there could be early age super genius person. If it were MBA, it should be around 30 years old to enter to MBA course. Why? My answer is experiment. Mathematics can only be done by paper and pen. If it were computer science, everything can be done within CPU. If it were physics, computer calculation is simulation. If it were MBA? One is require to apply his/her theory in real bisiness situation.

    <p class="my-p">
    The origin of research and study is philosophy. My degree is not doctor but upper master but there is a word philosophy. It is better than Master of Science and Master of Engineering. Why? Because philosophical speaking, my thesis or research is deeper than M.Sc or M.Eng thesis/research.
    </p>

    <p class="my-p">
    Then, the question is, what is a philosophy? Author thinks that which is what we believe. We believe newton's equation's motion. We believe theory and assumption of linear algebra. If it were MBA? They may believe case study works. This is my answer to that question.
