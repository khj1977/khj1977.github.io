        <p class="my-p">
        Deep learning is a hot topic in the world recent years. It is one kind of algorithm of machine learning and also one of the technique of AI. Deep learning is one kind of neural network. What is a neural network? What is a difference between deep learning and neural network? In this article, author's consideration will be shown.
        </p>

        <p class="my-p">
        One of an application of neural network is object recognition. It is kind of supervised learning. Neural network consists of neuron networks and output. There are several outputs and each output expresses class or kind of object. Using that output, object recognition or detection will be done.
        </p>

        <p class="my-p">
        Mathematically speaking, neural network is graph of neurons. There ie equivalent matrix of neural network. Then, learning and recognition is all about matrix calculation.
        </p>

        <p class="my-p">
        The question, here, is why using neural network, object detection can be done? What is step function? What is sigmoid function and why it is used?
        </p>

        <p class="my-p">
        According to text book of brain which is used for medical school student in Japan, brain consists of 13 billion number of neurons and kind of electricity is passed neuron to neuron. This is very similar to analogue electrical circuit. Actuall, author thinks that it is very similar to high order dynamical system.
        </p>

        <p class="my-p">
        If it were dynamical system, node or neuron is state and it has value. So, using sigmoid function, it is possible to expresss <em>fire</em> or memory of a value. It is very similar to bit of CPU. That means that brain is very similar to parallel process computer or CPU.
        </p>

        <p class="my-p">
        We use eye and brain to recognize object. Neural network emulate behaviour of brain and eye. So, using neural network as similarity, it is possible to recognize object with supervised learning. That is author's supposition.
        </p>

        <p class="my-p">
        The question is why deep learning? Author thinks that only difference between deep learning and ordinary neural network is its depth of layer of neurons. Actually, brain consists of 13 billion neurons. Classical neural network may not use so much neuron. That may be because of analysis and fast CPU to calculate by appropriate speed. Since deep learning gets closer to eye and especially, brain, it works well. This is author's supposition.
        </p>

        <p class="my-p">
        Note: In deep learing, there is technique called Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Author has not investigated RNN net. However, author suppooses it has good effect to output because brain may be naturally feedbacked loop dynamical system. Author supposes RNN may emulates behaviour of dynamics of brain well compared with feedforward neural network. However, author supposes an application of neural network model does not model every aspect of brain anytime, so using RNN would be depends on situation.
        </p>

        <p class="my-p">
        Also, brain would be consists of inter-connected subsystems with multiple feedback loops. Author supposes it would be better to use that idea to modelling of neural network or deep learning.
        </p>

        <p class="my-p">
        There is always physics behind mathematics. This is my first step to deep learning.
